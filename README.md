## Netlify link : https://frosty-payne-309908.netlify.app/

#### We are 4 students and we had 5 weeks to develop this app with a Nasa's API. The aim of the app was to predict a potential cataclysm with Earth.

- The first feature you'll see is the picture of the day directly collected from the API. It changes every day.
- Then, you'll enter in the app.
- You'll see the interface and the menu.
- You could see the different asteroides depending to the period you selected in the calendar.
- You could filter your research depending to the distance and asteroides's sizes.
- You could have access to different contents : 2 articles, one about asteroides defintion and the other one about dinosaurs extinction. other contents about legal mentions and our team.
